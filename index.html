   <p>I go by the name Angela Mila.

I am a confident, passionate, strong-willed young woman and former model (well, if a few modelling gigs can be considered modelling) and have always loved attention and still do (who doesn’t?). Enough about the cat-walk-life! As it happens, life needs constant restructuring and a girl’s got to have dreams, right. I want to be amongst the top successful black woman in the advertising space. After a stint in the coorporate world, I have no doubt that by applying
the knowledge and experiece, I am ready to slay the industry!</p>
